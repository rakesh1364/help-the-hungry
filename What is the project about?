Help the hungry project is to bring two communities together to benefit a third and most valuenrable community - people who either sleep with out any food or on one square meal a day.
Help the hungry is a website where two communities - a. The community who has excess food on almost daily basis such as restaurants and b. The community of Volunteers who can gather the excess food and take to the people who are hungry.
So for example restaurants who have access food can register themselves on this website and announce that they have access food for that day at and end of their business day. Next day morning the volunteers will check who has to offer the extra food, go to their restaurant and collect that excess food and distribute it in their local area to the needy people. The frequency can be daily or based on availability of volunteer(s).
Say on Monday evening restaurant X finds that they did not have the anticipated number of customers and their will be surplus food at end of the day, all they have to do is store their food in refrigerator for that night and at the same time via the app or website of helpthehungry.com let the volunteers know about excess food.
Next day early morning the Volunteers will get a notification on their smart devices about the excess food availability.
The Volunteers will go to the physical location where the excess food is and take that food to the needy.
That's all.
